This is the index of my blog. For the moment everything is a bit unorganized. As long as I incorporate more things I will make a more organized index:


## Bayesian Inference vs Point Estimate

In this first post I have just implemented some Bayesian and Point estimate Neural networks  models on a toy dataset with a pdf to specify the models and introducing a bit the algorithms. You need background on the topics to understand, they are not technical explanations. Models implemented:

* Point Estimate:
	+ Maximum Likelihood
	+ Maximum Posterior

* Bayesian Models:
	+ Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
	+ Variational Inference
	+ Variational Inference with Local Reparameretization

Just click [here](https://github.com/jmaronas/BlogCodeAndTutorials/tree/master/Bayesian_vs_PointEstimate) to go to the repository. You find there the necessary information.
