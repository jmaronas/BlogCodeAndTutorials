# BlogCodeAndTutorials

This is all about what it is in my mind. Basically is a lazy blog (yes, I do not like programming websites). If you like to contribute to this blog please send me and email: jmaronasm@gmail.com

## Short Bio

Hello, my name is Juan Maro√±as and I am a machine learning researcher at the PRHLT Research Center, Universidad Politecnica de Valencia. My interests are:

* Bayesian Inference in general: Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Gaussian Processes, Variational Inference 
* Graphical Models (very related to Bayesian Inference and Generative modelling)
* Generative models: Direct/Undirect Graphical Models, Autoregressive Models, Implicit Models (Gans and flow-based)
* Reliable Probabilistic Modelling: for optimal decision
* Semi-Supervised Learning (very related to generative and graphical models)
* Adversarial Examples
* Parallel programming (check my culayers library I created to learn CUDA and so on)

And basically any tool that can help us to improve the above topics: normalizing flows, strong regularization techniques, information theory metrics... My research is mainly focused on Bayesian Inference and Reliable Probabilistic modelling though I am always thinking about ideas on the different topics. 

Using the next scale A\*, A, B, C. This are the codes I know:

* PyTorch, Bash, Theano, Matlab (who us it? Nobody, but I was teached on it): A\*
* CUDA, C: A
* C++, TensorFlow, Keras: B
* VHDL, assembler: C

As you can imagine I do not like interfaces. For that reason I create my blog using simple markdown. If you like creating website you can create one for me, I will appreciate :D. I like to edit code with VIM or gedit (pycharm, sublime and all that takes to much time to configure for the gain in performance). I manage the computer cluster of my group (again in a very lazy way). However if you want the scripts to install several softwares: Tensorflow, PyTorch, Torch, Kaldi, CUDA, SRILM... just send me an email. These scripts install several versions of these softwares compiled against different CUDA libraries. I am planning to incorporate a queue system but still investigating which is the best and looking for time to do it.

I also try to help people in the PyTorch forum and I implement and create things I think might be usefull for the library and post it. 

TODO: put here information on my bachelor and so on

Appart from my work I like:

* music 
* plants
* swimming
* nature, going to the mountain
* go out with colleagues and travelling 
* sports: Real Madrid and watching Champions League; watch any important sport event (NBA, worldcub: basket, soccer, Eurocups...)
* Science: electromagnetic fields, quantuum fisics, astrophisic and mathematics (mainly probabilistic stuff, algebra and calculuus), though I am far from being competitive, I like see this things on this topics and get more new information.
* I am very antimillenial: do not have instagram, facebook just for log in some webpages, my live does not turn arround receiving likes on stupid stuff...
